For years waited, continuing to pay the annual fee. The sales folks that I spoke with were pleasant, but were not knowledgeable. Do better!

13593221655,Chicago Doug,1,Frustrating app with bad data,"Whoop grossly undercounts steps causing the app to give an elevated age to the user. The app’s algorithms are set so that it will only count steps if your arms are in swinging motion and even then it undercounts. As an example if I show 12,000 steps in Apple Health the Whoop app may show around 6500 steps. The AI function is extremely frustrating. Not able to continue previous conversations. Very difficult to navigate through the app to find where to check or change settings. The sleep tracking is invariably incorrect and when trying to add naps or added sleep it will then delete previously detected sleep.

I still get angry when I think about that I prepaid 12 months for this piece of garbage. Do yourself a favor and save yourself hours and hours of frustration by not buying this. I’d recommend making a nice beach fireplace and preferably just throw your money in there if you have too much of it. There’s no need to purchase bonus headaches, there’s plenty of free ones out there.

13514184629,BigDinDa805,4,Heart rate detection during exercise is extremely inaccurate,"UPDATE: latest update to the app seems to have fixed the heart rate inaccuracy. 👍🏻 

I have WHOOP and an Apple Watch. During exercise, the whoop will randomly drop the heart rate reading. When my heart rate is between 150 and 160, the WHOOP will say it under 100 for an extended period of time and then jump back up to the accurate reading. The Apple Watch is entirely more accurate and doesn’t drop the reading mid work out. This is the only weakness of WHOOP that I have found, but it’s a big deal. An inaccurate heart reading impacts your strain for the day, the calories burned, and other things in the app. Please fix the heart rate monitor.

13494547073,Maddy LAMB,5,Daily Rhythm of Peace,"WHOOP has been far more than a fitness tracker to me — it has been a partner in my personal rebirth. Over the past year, this tiny band helped me rise into the woman God designed me to be. It showed me the truth about my sleep, my strain, my recovery, and my stress patterns… but more importantly, it revealed a deeper relationship between my faith, my mindset, and my physiology.

My Heart Rate Variability — a real, scientific marker of resilience — didn’t just inch upward… it transformed. It became visible, measurable evidence that my inner peace practice was literally reshaping my nervous system. I wasn’t just feeling different. WHOOP proved that I was different.

Every green recovery felt like God whispering, ‘You’re aligned.’
Every red day reminded me, ‘Rest is sacred.’
And watching my HRV rise became the key to my own inner vault — proof that peace, discipline, and divine alignment can be tracked, trained, and embodied.”

WHOOP helped me regulate my nervous system, rebuild consistency, restore trust with my body, and return to the woman of presence and power I thought I’d lost. It didn’t just optimize my life — it transformed my identity.

2. On the second day the app just did not log any activity whatsoever. There were no step counts, no calories, nothing at all. 

3. Then half past midnight on the third day everything got logged but to my utter disbelief, all data for day 2 was logged as if it happened on day 3. I mean the day had just started and half an hour into 3rd day it logged 5000 steps and 2500 calories. Ofcourse day 2’s data was still missing.

13401993631,ORIO11,5,Really is the best,"So I have been very skeptical of the whoop, so many people hate on it because of the membership and other reasons around accuracy. 

However, I have tested it for myself against my apple watch, my oura ring, my garmin and coros watch lol. 

Honestly apple is the best when it comes to HR tracking. But they do not give you any insights, or use any sort of algorithmic analysis tool which is really where the magic happens. 

Whoop is absolutely accurate enough on Hr data for the use case’s its intended for. Pair that with the algorithms they use and constant analysis against many other markers and you have the best health and fitness tool on the market. Ive seen countless videos on youtube saying how apple watch with athylitic or bevel are just as good if not better. I personally do not agree. Those apps dont have great UX, the results are confusing and dont seem super accurate to me. However they compile data and analyze it just isnt at the level of whoop. 

The whoop is comfortable and thr app is really amazing. I love the interface, the data makes a lot of sense and its easy to understand and make actionable choices with it. Its super focused on gives me exactly what i need and nothing more that i dont. I hear some people asking for nutrition tracking… please dont lol its just another manual task that is calorie focused and not very accurate in my opinion. It kind of grtd away from thr whole athletics and performance tracker and makes it more of a wellness tool.

Of the random disconnections Sometimes the band does not get recognized by Bluetooth whatsoever, even if the device is charged. I’ve also heard negative results from the 5.0 that’s the same fate.

First the good things. Comfortable and non intrusive to wear. But that is where it ends. The much touted recovery feature isn’t all that. I regularly ignore it, as well as the daily strain recommendations, and it seems to have no impact and I am no spring chicken. 

Having used it for around an year, as an average fitness enthusiast who gets in 4-6 intense workouts a week, there aren’t any other metrics you can’t get elsewhere, for a fraction of the price. 

Next, any upgrades will render your existing accessories like bands (which come at an extra cost) useless, without disclaimers before you upgrade, because they change the size of their core product. 

Customer service, when contacted about the issue above, said they were ‘glad’ to tell me that the unused accessory can’t be used on the upgraded version (I am sure they were glad). Additionally, their solutions were either for me to not use the upgrade I paid for already and go back to the older version or reel in another fish for them who can pay them subscription money while using the band I paid for.

Further the Home and Health page are redundant and the health page is really just trying to upsell me constantly - I’m annoyed every time I click into it.

I tried multiple times, but nothing worked. The promised functionality simply doesn’t work.

But I’m giving 3 stars because there are still some gaps, especially when it comes to women’s health tracking.

To be clear, the app does offer cycle tracking, which I appreciate, but I still find it quite bare. Personally, one of the most important tools for understanding my body is temperature trend data—specifically basal body temperature. Right now, the app shows a daily temperature reading, but I can’t see past data in a graph or timeline. Without that, I can’t spot patterns, make informed decisions, or understand how my cycle is affecting recovery and performance.

Temperature trends are incredibly informative not just for cycle tracking, but for training adjustments, stress management, fertility awareness, and even postpartum recovery. Whether someone is trying to conceive, manage hormonal fluctuations, or navigate perimenopause, this kind of data matters. And when we can correlate it with metrics like HRV, strain, and recovery, it makes for a much more complete picture of health.

Whoop gets so much right, and I’m hopeful they’ll build this feature in for a more insightful platform. Add this one piece, and it’s a no-brainer 5 stars.",5.13.0,2025-07-29T07:02:41-07:00

It says all over the place on their marketing that it’s HSA eligible and that was the only reason that I actually want to go for this and then when you put in your HSA card, it doesn’t work.  It’s really confusing why it was rejected and you have to Google around. So apparently you have to submit to HSA which I’m sure a ton of people will forget and I am also sure it’s so whoop saves money no directly processing it themselves.
Seems like a technicality, but I’m sure the amount of people that won’t actually be able to have the time to follow through with this and lose money is substantial.
Also, they don’t actually know if it’s approved until the purchase goes through and the whole submission process happens and if HSA doesn’t cover it. You can’t reverse gears at that point…
Also, I literally had to use AI to understand the difference between MG, 5.0, one, peak and life.

12847392940,Smurfml,2,Disappointed by Whoop: Save Your $300!,"This gadget is absolutely incapable of accurately tracking your sleep. 
If you’re going through menopause, struggling with sleep, and thinking this bracelet might help… don’t bother and save yourself $300!

If you wake up in the middle of the night, stay awake for a while, and then fall back asleep, the device doesn’t detect that you went back to sleep. In the morning, it tells you that your recovery was 34%. But if you manually enter your actual wake-up time, magically your recovery jumps to 93%—completely ignoring the fact that you were awake for hours during the night.

Or picture this: you have a restless night, wake up 50 times, toss and turn in bed, and finally fall into deep sleep around 5:30 AM. Just then, the bracelet vibrates on your wrist and wakes you up in the middle of a dream, leaving you groggy and exhausted. You think it’s the latest time in your smart alarm window (9:15 AM)… but it’s only 8:15! You’re left thinking you must’ve recovered well—though you feel awful. You open the app, and it tells you: “We’re currently unable to detect data.” So… why did you wake me up??

And when you finally manage to sleep well for once, and wake up truly rested… the device tells you your recovery is only 62% because your Heart Rate Variability dropped. Seriously?! Who cares! I finally slept well and feel great!

I used to think the Apple Watch was bad… but compared to this Whoop, it deserves an honorary degree!",5.6.0,2025-07-03T05:56:49-07:00
12843160612,TDYmannn,3,No Support For Broken App,"I have my grievances with the algorithm still underreporting strain for functional fitness and always demanding I sleep 9 hours despite full recovery and more than enough restorative sleep at 7.5 hours. I disagree, but fine, I still find the data useful.  What I can’t forgive is broken app features that ‘support’ says could be fixed by a future update so just make sure I keep my app up to date. ‘App settings’ tab redirects me to profile. Cannot access app settings, which is very frustrating because I continually need to edit HR zones based on the cardio modality I’m doing. I took a video of this glitch and sent to support after logging out/in, deleting and reinstalling the app, and did all the things. Support responds by saying, we’ve escalated this to our internal team for further investigation.  I reached out for an update several days later and have not gotten a response. So firstly it seems when you reach out to support your not actually talking to a whoop agent as they’re self admittedly not a part of the internal team?  Secondly, I’m offered zero support or follow up. Can’t even get someone from the internal team to tell me my app is broken and won’t be fixed. Literally zero help. Lastly, Whoop needs to allow different HR zone profiles for various activities. It’s widely known in the sports world that cycling hr zones are 10 bpm lower than running.

Whoop has continually impressed me with its product and the insights it provides into my health and performance. The data I’ve received has been invaluable, helping me understand my recovery, strain, and sleep patterns better than ever before.

Each iteration of the Whoop band seems to improve upon the last, with enhanced features and more accurate tracking. The insights it provides are not just numbers; they offer actionable information that can help optimize workouts and recovery. However, I do feel that there is room for improvement, particularly in terms of integrations with other fitness services.

For instance, I use a workout tool called Fitbod, which offers in-depth workout planning and insights. It would be fantastic if Whoop could pull data from Fitbod, allowing both platforms to work together seamlessly. The combination of Whoop's recovery insights with Fitbod's detailed workout analytics could create a powerhouse of fitness data, helping users like me get even better results.

Overall, Whoop is an excellent tool for anyone serious about their fitness journey. The insights are top-notch, but more integrations with other fitness technologies would take this product to the next level.

The UX is whatever, adding and editing strength workouts is a pain, and the list goes on.

Makes me question the sincerity of the whole operation. Just another money syphon? Seems so with the new pricing tiers through which you have to “unlock” extra measurements that are already there.

Too late for me to return this thing, but I would otherwise.

Here are some issues that I’ve observed:
The activity tracking and app navigation is lacking, plus if you’re not always running the app in the background it can have some serious sync issues.
Honestly, even if you are always running it, it still has sync issues. 
It often chokes on random activities that I add and then takes forever to process the data. Sometimes the same happens with sleep data. 

This never happened on my old Garmin and as it is now, I’m likely going to return.

How data is displayed is also not super intuitive, why do I have this weird live heart rate monitor thing but can’t see a graph with my logged heart rate? Seems suspicious, are they just interpolating a bunch of datapoints between sporadic measurements?

Other issues:
Changing unit system doesn’t work for strength training, can’t search the menu for settings (standard feature by now), no way to give feedback in-app, getting support is just an AI and it’s hard to get somebody to fix issues, some activities/exercises are not in the list and cannot be added manually (archery, and jumping lunges for exercises for example), … there are a few issues that seem like low-hanging fruit considering this is version 5 of this device.",5.3.0,2025-06-18T15:42:07-07:00

12653145339,egsdee_,1,5 Year Customer - Cancelling,"This review would have been 5 stars had it been written it in 2021. However, Whoop - their product, their management team, and ultimately their value proposition have changed, and thus so has my perception of it.

I’ve had some great success since joining Whoop in 2020. The device provided some extremely useful insights, particularly around sleep, that I have used to improve my life. 

Whoop as a company was, in my view, consistently on the cutting edge of wearable fitness tech. I believe what once was a laser-focus on product and software development has eroded to one of marketing gimmicks and misinformation. So much of their spending and time now goes into having pro athletes be seen wearing a Whoop as opposed to actually improving product accuracy, performance, and experience.

Further, I cannot in good faith recommend a company who markets a <10% size reduction as a crowning product achievement that took years to develop, when all of its users know it’s simply to make all 4.0 accessories obsolete. 

Whoop has investors to answer to. I get it. It’s a corporate world, but they have been in the process of a multi-year misassessment of their niche in the marketplace. You can’t grow when the bucket is leaking, so I’m voting on what the company has become with my wallet.

Garmin and Apple have not only caught up, but surpassed Whoop in all the ways that made it unique. Their sensors are better, UI/UX equally intuitive and beautiful, and features much broader and more extensive. Oh, and you can get a new one every year as opposed to paying a subscription that no longer covers the cost of new hardware when it releases.",4.6.342,2025-05-13T16:04:25-07:00

It seems if you are not constantly on top of updates or willing to reboot it, you go multiple days without your normal data. I’ve contacted Whoop but they don’t give me any more assistance than what their chat bot and FAQ say, and this is something friends have also warned me about.

Additionally, the sync to Strava is also a subpar experience. Unless you track a workout with all your reps and sets live, it will prematurely send your activity to Strava before you have added in your workout to calculate the proper strain and calories, thus making your workouts either slow and distracted, or your Strava data inaccurate. It does not update when you calculate muscular load or offer an option to send to Strava after you track your workout. Additionally, Whoop will automatically track an activity often incorrectly and send this. When you change it, changes not reflected in 3rd party apps it sends to. 

Also, the mapping and GPS capabilities are atrocious. Testing side by side with my Garmin, it is completely inaccurate and only gushes your steps and exertion fairly well. Always short changing and the battery dies fast. Compared to my very simple and easy-to-use Garmin instinct which I’ve had for 6 years and still has a great battery, easy to use and track workouts (including muscular load, reps & weight), Whoop has been more of a frustration.

The bracelet set up, especially if you get a band other than the default black, is comically frustrating. For a company that has done so well and has gained so much traction, it is beyond me why they haven’t made the design simpler. The set up itself is next to impossible, and the instructions included are not going to help you. It’s like they hired monkeys to make the bracelet set up, that and the instructions. No joke.

I have it now, and have loved the product itself so far, and would recommend it there, but the set up was so frustrating that that small block of your day, week, month etc. that you spend setting this up, makes it not worth it. It’s unbelievable. It was enough to make me write this review- I’ve never written a review for anything. Cool product, but day 1 you should be prepared to bring a tool belt and be at your sharpest, otherwise you’d best make yourself comfortable because you could end up sitting there all day.

Who am I, but whoever was in charge of that should be bagging groceries because they are not good at what they do. If you get past set up it’s an awesome product with some cool features. Do with this what you will. Cheers",4.6.337,2025-04-20T18:13:42-07:00

12527493830,okkahwhja,5,Whoop app’s potential to support mental health disorders,"As a student in Abnormal Psychology, I found the Whoop app to be equally interesting and relevant in how it relates to topics in my course. Especially concerning stress, anxiety, and sleep disorders. This app tracks physiological data like sleep cycles, heart rate variability, and recovery. Which are all relevant to the biological determinants of stress related conditions and anxiety disorders. Chronic stress for example, poor recovery scores or irregular heart rate patterns can show up due to heightened sympathetic nervous system activity. Heightened nervous system activity is often seen in individuals with PTSD and GAD. 
One of the most useful features of the Whoop app was the sleep coach. This feature aligns closely with disorders covered in class, it supports cognitive-behavioral approaches to insomnia, by encouraging good “sleep hygiene”.  By tracking factors like strain or late-night activity and their impact on sleep quality. This could be helpful for individuals struggling with mood or anxiety disorders, where sleep is often disrupted. 
One thing I have noticed is that this constant monitoring could become counterproductive for some people. In abnormal Psych we have discussed how individuals with OCD or illness anxiety disorder can become hyper focused on their bodily sensations. In this context, an app like this may unintentionally trigger compulsive checking/tracking. While Whoop promotes healthy self-awareness it’s important to recognize the potential for mal use. 
Overall, I’ve found that Whoop bridges the gap between technology and psychology, by offering health insight, and tracking how the body responds to stress and sleep. Whoop provides a great amount of biofeedback that supports wellbeing which could be used to support people struggling with stress, anxiety, and sleep disorders.",4.6.332,2025-04-10T12:30:32-07:00

Despite raising this concern, the company showed no interest in addressing the issue. Instead of investigating or acknowledging a potential bug in their system, they dismissed my concerns and simply provided a link to request a refund. This response suggests they are indifferent to the accuracy of their product and unwilling to address potential flaws.

My concern is that if the sleep data is inaccurate, then all other related data generated by the tracker is likely compromised, rendering the product unreliable.

I emailed their customer service regarding this and they proved a loving, understanding, and human company. It was very refreshing to be heard and understood.

12350340792,I’m unsure_2007,2,Going downhill,"Amazing when it first came out but seriously…
TLDR: in 3 years the only meaningful update was journal+correlations on software, a bunch of clothes, and huge endorsements. Otherwise, I’m unsure what whoop is doing. They only need a 20 person team to do what they have accomplished.

My feedback:
- App needs a huge overhaul. It is one of the messiest and redundant-laden pieces of software on my device. It’s just a huge collection of descriptive statistics with a touch of correlations. 
- monthly and weekly reports need overhaul. Anyone with any experience with charts will tell you that there’s much more insightful ways of presenting the data
- Sensors need improvement. The accuracy, especially when doing any activity, is grossly delayed and inaccurate vs Polar (electro) or even Apple Watch (optical, like Whoop)
- Straps are an insane cash grab. Priced similar to Apple Watch straps, but last 6-8 mo vs my Apple ones last 2-3 years
- ‘AI’ is a joke. Mucks up answers most of the time. I exported data => GPT => asked same questions and the insights were FAR more useful
- Where is the 5.0? I’ve been paying $250/yr for 4 years now and only got the 4.0 upgrade…. Vs. Apple went from near-useless to full blown Ultra with similar functionality as Whoop with 3rd party apps in the same timeframe

The Whoop application and user management infrastructure is designed to be hard to navigate, bitterly difficult to get truly helpful customer service from, and most of all, impossible to end your membership through.

11954027593,Nolan_C15,1,Hidden Minimum 12 Month Commitment - Extremely Misleading and not transparent,"I’ve never felt the need to write a poor review before but I’m shocked by the hidden 12 month commitment that comes with simply wanting to try the Whoop for a little longer past the free trial.

The Whoop is a great product, don’t get me wrong, it provides really granular analytics on my health and works how it’s advertised. 

But I think it’s RIDICULOUS for their policy to lock someone in to be committed for 12 months the second the free trial is over. It’s not clear or apparent whatsoever when you sign up for the free trial and if you’re going to have a policy like that, it should be blatantly clear and highlighted in the UI rather than make it seem like it’s no commitment whatsoever.

I genuinely just wanted to use it for an additional month or two - im on my third month and I specifically switched to monthly payments to avoid being locked into a year. If the policy is that im locked into a year minimum regardless, I think its a extremely poor outlook on Whoop to even let me choose monthly given that if I canceled before 12 months, id have to buy out the remaining months and pay more. That’s super misleading to the user because if whoop was to be transparent, they should warn the user that switching to monthly simply doesn’t make sense because they’re locked in for 12 months regardless so paying 30/month instead of the yearly fee is just asking to pay more.

I’ve spoken to couple of my friends who are currently in their free trial and none of them were aware of this either. They had the same idea as me, saying you just need to switch your membership to monthly in the portal which is exactly what I thought and did, but clearly that’s not the case.",4.6.307,2024-11-15T13:21:37-07:00

So I enter the user name and password I was previously asked to make. It fails and says “The email address has already been taken. Enter another email address or login if this is yours.” (ya don’t say?)

But the “login if this is yours” link is broken, so I have no way of continuing the pairing of this device. Of course I have tried force quitting the app and retrying multiple times. 

Amazing that I will have to send back a piece of hardware strictly due to the incompetence of a software team and their inability to properly QA.",4.6.290,2024-09-13T15:57:34-07:00

However, there have been several instances where I set my alarm on whoop for an exact time and it goes off an hour earlier or later. Normally it happens when I travel and whoop doesn’t change with the time zone. But today my alarm went off at 4:30am vs the 5:30am time I set. Please fix this part of the software.

11707677263,Smallhoss,2,Too expensive for too many flaws,"TLDR: interesting information, but not helpful information. 

There are flaws with both the wearable device and the app. For the high cost it is simply not worth it. The information you receive is definitely interesting, but not something most people would ever act on. 

The device is annoying and constantly sliding down your wrist, doesn’t actually have time keeping on it which I get that it’s supposed to be minimalist, but come on. 

The app has far bigger issues. The biggest is that all processing is done off app. I assume this is so apple doesn’t have access to their proprietary data, but it also severely limits the functionality of the app. Want to track the stress on your body while hiking, camping, mountain biking, skiing, etc? Can’t do it. Anywhere you don’t have service it simply won’t work because the app won’t do the math on your phone. Other than that it looks sleek, but is a little cumbersome to use. Please fix the new strength training section. It is so annoying to start and stop the timer for each set, and not necessary.",4.6.290,2024-09-09T18:27:08-07:00

Insane and scammy business model. What do you pay for the device for if you have to keep “buying” it every year forever?

11643803583,Chula in Cali,3,Demotivating,"It’s been about a month. WHOOP and I have been getting to know each other. I found the first few weeks to be very demotivating because my Apple Watch seemed to give me a more accurate feedback for the intensity I was putting out during workouts. 

I am guessing this band would work wonderfully for semi professional or professional athletes. For example, I had an hour and a half of intense strength training and it said I burned about 100 calories. Mind you, I often had to catch my breath. I was sweating. It was a fabulous workout. But when you look at WHOOP, it’s like whoa. So low. A 3 mile brisk walk only burned 100 cal and I was out of breath and sweating the whole time because I take my fitness seriously and the whoop  was like “sorry buddy try harder next time.” 

I guess I need to kill myself in order to get a strain or burn calories?

Now my partner has slightly high blood pressure. So when she works out, her strain numbers are astronomical. 

On the positive, I’m working harder. So that’s a good thing right? I did realize that I could push myself harder, which was really good——for that reason alone I’m keeping the WHOOP for the entire year of the subscription with purchase of the band.

However, at this point, I’m not sure that I would re-up once my subscription is done.

Ps. Why can’t they use a Pedometer? It would be wonderful because we wear it 24/7?!",4.6.287,2024-08-23T07:34:47-07:00

11617387814,NorthBethesdaTroglodyte,3,Tried it for a year; not for me,"Whoop appealed for me as a lower cost way to try out some smartwatch features. However, a caution to those considering the free trial: Some number of Whoop’s features will not calibrate in that first month. You would need to hang onto the device for longer to unlock insights or track your body temp over time.

The Whoop algorithms just don’t seem to work for me, an active middle-aged person who is not a self-described athlete. I had a lot of recovery and strain scores that did not match my energy level or perceived rate of exertion. The Whoop “Insights” tab just runs correlations, so don’t depend on that data too much. Things that very obviously were not helpful to my health and recovery, like having a migraine, ranked reasonably highly as contributing to my recovery in the Whoop app.  

Over my year with the Whoop, I found the app demotivating. After a two-hour workout where I spent 80 minutes at 80-90% of my max heart rate, the app told me I had a “restorative day.” During weeks when I was losing weight (in a calorie deficit) and exercising regularly, Whoop estimated my calorie expenditure at just 1440 calories per day, well under the 1700-1800 calories online calculators estimate someone my age, sex, height, and weight needs for at their resting metabolic rate. The calorie expenditure estimates during my workouts were laughably low; I was once credited with 33 calories for 25 minutes of rowing at a moderate pace. Two days later, the app said a 30-minute moderate rowing workout burning 202 calories—still low but a wildly different number. 

I wanted better ways to track my workouts while using Whoop. My first problem is that some number of my highest strain workouts are in the backcountry. Without a cell signal, Whoop routinely loses data, especially if you have more than one workout in a day. There is no automated way to compare data (distances, pacing, heart rate) over time or to export it to an app that can make those comparisons. 

Charging didn’t work well on my device (v 4.0). Overnight charging never restored the battery to better than 90 percent. Most recently, I awoke to find my battery had gone from 8 percent to just 40-something percent while I slept. The battery pack is also a bit uncomfortable to wear due to its bulk and weight. Sometimes a full charge last five days, and other times it last two days. 

I used the vibrating alarm a few times and then never again. In my experience, no amount of smacking it—hard enough to awaken my bed partner—would shut it off. Perhaps because my heart rate remains low after awakening, the device didn’t register that I was awake?

The device and app also feel like they are in constant beta mode, and I expected more for the price. I think I’m going to go for a tried-and-tested Apple Watch as my next wearable.",4.6.284,2024-08-16T09:13:22-07:00
